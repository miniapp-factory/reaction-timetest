#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### The screen turns green after a random delay. The player taps as fast as possible. The score is based on reaction speed.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to create a new file for the logo image description. Please add the following file to the chat:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to update `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and create the logo description.

I need the current contents of the files that will be edited.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can generate the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once those files are added, I’ll provide the changes.

A simple green square logo featuring a stylized stopwatch icon in the center. The background is a solid bright green (#00FF00). The stopwatch is a white circle with a black hourglass shape and a red second hand pointing upward, symbolizing speed and timing. The design is minimalistic and conveys the core idea of a reaction time test.
